Write a program that takes an integer as input and outputs its reverse. 
You can use a loop to extract each digit and build the reversed number.


#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n, rev = 0, r;
    printf("Enter a number:");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int m = n;
    while (n > 0)
    {
        r = n % 10;
        rev = rev * 10 + r;
        n = n / 10;
    }
    printf("Reverse of %d is %d", m, rev);
    return 0;
}
