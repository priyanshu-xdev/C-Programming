Write a C program that takes three integers as input: two numbers, start and end, representing a range, and a third number, divisor.
The program should count how many numbers between start and end (inclusive) are divisible by the divisor.

Example:

Input: start = 1, end = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3 (numbers 3, 6, and 9 are divisible by 3)


#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a, b, c, count = 0;
    printf("Enter Start Number:");
    scanf("%d", &a);
    printf("Enter End Number:");
    scanf("%d", &b);
    printf("Enter Divisor Number:");
    scanf("%d", &c);
    for (int i = a; i <= b; i++)
    {
        if (i % c == 0)
        {
            count++;
        }
    }
    printf("Total Number=%d", count);
    return 0;
}
