Write a program to calculate the sum of even and odd numbers separately from 1 to N, where N is an input provided by the user.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n, even = 0, odd = 0, count;
    printf("Enter a Number:");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (count = 1; count <= n; count++)
    {
        if (count % 2 == 0)
        {
            even = even + count;
        }
        else
        {
            odd = odd + count;
        }
    }
    printf("Sum of even numbers :%d\n", even);
    printf("Sum of odd numbers :%d", odd);
    return 0;
}
